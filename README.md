# employee_cab_PickAndDropService_website
This website can be used by companies to approach third parties dealing with transport services. The companies can avail pick and drop services for their employees according to the start and destination spot as registered by the employee while first availing the service. There are 2 types of login, one for the Company and the other for the Employee. The company can select the type of vehicle as per the demand and accordingly the rates are decided on quarterly, semi-yearly or yearly basis. Employees can check their status as to how many days are remaining until the next subscription and if needed inform or remind the company for the renewal of the services before the subscription ends.
